			SPA - Single Paged Application
	where, we send a single HTML page to client (Index.html - default page name)
	This page has app component loaded, and app components knows about other components
	Thus index.html is made up of multiple components further and we are only sending index.html 

	A service runs in browser memory which will load the component as per uses request

	Routing is configured in 2 steps
	1. in app-routing-module.ts add routes(components) and path(url)
	2. in app.component.html - use <a Link for links and router-outlet
