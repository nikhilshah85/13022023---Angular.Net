.Net Angular 
--- .Net for webapi development (to talk to data source) - this is based on REST standards
		we had got an URL - to be shared with client app - Angular 

	but, then if any1 has the url can create their application and get data, 
	and thats why WebAPI comes with CORS - Cross Origin Resource Shareing



1. Create a new webapi app
2. create an new angular app - try to consume the api here useing HttpClient
3. We will see an error - CORS
4. We see how to fix it
